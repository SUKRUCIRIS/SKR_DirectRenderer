# Warning
This library has been added to SKR framework (https://github.com/SUKRUCIRIS/SKR) and this repository won't be updated anymore.

# SKR_DirectRenderer
This is a render library which is built on win32/direct2d. This library contains functions that simplify rendering in many areas. I spent a lot of time making this library and will be using it in my own projects. I don't plan to do something like documentation in the near future, but if you want to use this library and have a question about it, you can contact me.
